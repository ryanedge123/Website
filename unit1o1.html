            <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3></div>
            <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">IT has become a necessity for most modern businesses, whether it be a small shop using computers to order in new stock or take online orders, up to big corporations using IT for fast communication between teams and for planning out and creating their next big project. Even if the business itself is not heavily reliant on computers, IT can still help speed up a lot of processes, even if it is only used for things like market research and research in general, communication, and maybe even looking up help for a problem you are unable to fix yourself.</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3></div>
            <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">There are a lot skills, methods and resources needed to complete a digital project, at the start of a project one of the most important things is a good research method, making sure you have the information you need to complete the project, if this is not done then you could end up making a lot of mistakes that could have been avoided. A good skill for a project  is time and project management, making sure you have enough time to complete the project and being able to make sure you and your team are completing the most important parts first.</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3></div>
            <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">One of the important parts of planning a project is to break it down into individual task in order to make it easier to see what exactly you have to do, this is also useful when it comes to time management as it will make it easier to see exactly how much work you need to do, this is known as the kanban method, Trello is very effect at doing this. Trello is also useful as you can set reminders and alarms to notify you when certain tasks have deadlines and when those deadlines are coming up, this can be very useful as you know which tasks need to be completed first.</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3></div>
            <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">There are many risks when it comes to digital projects, a big risk is security, there can be situations where people could get access to your project by hacking into your online accounts and stealing your information, you could also get viruses that infect your computers and corrupt your files causing you to lose your project completely. Another big risk is the project not working due to the methods used to create it not working, like certain bits of code just not being able to work together or maybe another project has been completed by somebody else that just works better or offers more. These risks can be negated by increasing security and being careful with your accounts and doing more market research to make sure your project hasn’t already been done before.</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3></div>
            <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">When it comes to IT in modern business one of the key aspects is knowing what software to use for your project, this is very important since picking the wrong one or not using software at all could slow down or even stop your project in its tracks. A good method to figuring out what you’ll need is the kanban method, breaking down the project into tasks you can then see what you’ll need to complete each one. Another important part is to research what software would be best for the project, as you might already have one in mind but another piece of software might be more efficient at the job, saving yourself time.</p></div>

            <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h3></div>
            <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">There are a lot of technologies that can help you with your digital project, i have spoken about Trello before, it is extremely useful in breaking down and keeping track of tasks that need to be completed, i use this site a lot as it helps me with my project management, another technology that i use is Slack, it allows me to communicate with other team members instantly so if there is a problem i can contact them right away, it is also useful for posting my work so it can be reviewed by others and i can be told if im on the right track. Another great site is github, github allows teams of people to work on a project, and all their work can be uploaded to the same file and github will sort it out for you, this allows a member of the team to go onto github and they can download the latest version of the project.</p></div>

            <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3></div>
            <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">An important aspect of any Business or project is the legal guidelines that need to be followed, one of the most important guidelines is copyright infringement. When working on a project you need to make sure that whatever you’re making isn’t infringing on someone's copyrighted material, you can avoid this by making everything yourself and documenting it but if you need to use someone else work then you need to make sure that it is not copyrighted or that the copyright owner has given you written permission to use their work in your project.</p></div>
