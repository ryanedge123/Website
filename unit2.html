    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">Copyright is the right that a person has to a piece of work they have created, copyright falls under Intellectual property. “Intellectual property gives a person ownership over the things they create, the same way as something physical can be owned.” If the work a person creates is original and their own then it automatically falls under copyright and is protected. The only way to use copyrighted material in other projects is to receive permission from the owner of the copyrighted work. The copyrights can be passed onto another person, if the person who created the original work was paid to make it by someone else or if the rights to the work are purchased after it was made.

    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">There are many things that need to be taken into account when designing a website, one of the more important aspects is how people will access it. There are many access issues people might face when using your website, people with disabilities may face more access issues then most. One of the most important when it comes to website design is visual impairment, as some people will struggle with visuals you need to make the important information as visible as possible, another aspect of this is colourblind people, making important buttons a certain colour scheme could help make them easier to read.</p></div>

    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 2 1.7  Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">
        The two most common files for a website are .jpg and .gif, these are both used for different jobs, one is a still image and the other is for very short videos that repeat. There is another image format that is also used, .png, typically used instead of jpg but is sometimes considered unreliable.</p></div>
