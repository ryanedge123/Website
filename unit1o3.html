    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 1 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">There have been a lot of systems and software used in this project to help complete it, these systems have been very beneficial to productivity and have helped me be extremely efficient in creating this website. Trello especially was helpful in keeping up productivity as it allowed me to easily keep track of work, also being able to use the internet to help research code and systems that i can use. A downside to this is problems with distraction and feature creep, in doing research into CSS and Javascript, a lot of interesting things pop up and having to stop myself from wanting to put all of this into the website can be tough. This website could have been made bigger and faster if we were in teams but teams create their own problems themselves as communication and teamwork becomes a big thing to do right.</p></div>

    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 1 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">There are many ways to improve productivity and efficiency when working on an IT based project, an important way is to thoroughly plan the project from the very beginning, making sure that everything you need is fully planned for and to make sure the methods you will be using to complete the project are the most efficient methods available, another way is to use time most effectively, focus on the big and the most important aspects of the project first, make sure these are completed and are working before moving onto the smaller parts of the project.</p></div>
    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 1 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">After having written about ways to improve productivity and efficiency when making IT based projects there are methods i could adopt and implement that would help me on my next project, i’ve written about Trello a few times because i do believe it is extremely effective, a way i could use it better is to put reminders and alarms onto each task to remind me of when it needs to be finished by and when i am getting close to the end date, this would help me choose the more important aspects first. Another way would be to work in a team, working with other people does bring some of it’s own problems but overall the extra manpower out ways the negatives as it would allow us to create the project quicker and allow us to implement more on the site itself.</p></div>

    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 1 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">Once you have finished a section of code or a part of your project you need to start looking back through your code and see if you can detect any future issues that might arise from the way you have written it, if you cannot spot any then you can begin testing it to make sure it works and doesn’t crash, you need to start by running the code or going to the website and making sure every button implemented takes you to the correct location and doesn’t crash, you also need to go through and check everything implemented a few times, a good thing to do at this point is to get someone else to test your code, this can be useful because having other people try it could lead to them testing it in different ways then you would and could lead to them finding problems you wouldn’t have found. After having the person test the code you can also get them to have a look through it to see if they can detect any problems that might come up in the future</p></div>
