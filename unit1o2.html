    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">unit 1 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">The tools currently being used to make the website are, Visual studio code with HTML and CSS languages. I am also using Trello to help keep track of all the tasks I need to do and how long I have left to do them. I think these pieces of software are very useful for creating a website, I have not run into any problems with using them.</p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 1 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">As mentioned i am using Visual Studio Code to fully code the website and i am using trello to plan and keep track of the project in general, i find these tools to be very useful and good at the tasks, i have also used a little javascript in the website which has helped a lot and has allowed me to do a bit more then HTML and CSS would.</p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 1 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">Now that the project is completed i can look back on what i have done and review it, i feel like the site is good and well made, everything works as intended and there don’t seem to be any issues on the technical side of things, there are some chances at code clean up but it all still works, the parts of the site im not happy with are the visuals, i think what i have is good but i just feel like there needs to be more, there are some empty spaces that could be filled up to make the site more visually appealing.</p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 1 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">There are other improvements i could make to site, such as better formatting to make the text or the navigation bar fit the screen better so it all looks more clean, i could also have used more CSS to put text into boxes to make it all look nicer but the main one is just filling it in and making each page look more interesting. Another way i could improve would be including drop down menus so it is easier to navigate around my site, on the portfolio section, it could end up becoming an extremely large page and if the user wished to find certain parts of the portfolio a drop down menus would be invaluable.</p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="center"><h3 class="blocktext2">Unit 1 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3></div>
    <div class="center"><p class="blocktext">The original intention of this website was to create a place where i could post my 3D work, to show it off and to talk about it and the process of making it, i also wanted a site where i could talk in general about my interest in games design, i feel i have hit one of these goals  as i now have a portfolio page to show off my work, although i do feel as if it could be improved with better formatting, it does currently get the job done, the only goal i have fallen short is talking about my interests in detail, i would need to add a more in depth blog section at some point.</p></div>
